upgrade:
  - |
    The ``check_foreign_keys`` helper of the
    ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.test_migrations.ModelsMigrationsSync`` base test class
    has been removed. This was deprecated in 1.4.1 as alembic now supports this
    capability.
  - The ``_walk_versions``, ``_migrate_down``, and ``_migrate_up`` methods of
    the ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.test_migrations.ModelsMigrationsSync`` base test
    class have been removed. These were deprecated in 0.5.0 in favour of their
    non-private equivalents, ``walk_versions``, ``migrate_down``, and
    ``migrate_up`` respectively.
