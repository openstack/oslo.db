upgrade:
  - |
    The ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.migration`` module and ``WalkVersionsMixin``
    test mixin in the ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.test_migrations``, which were
    removed in 13.0.0, have been re-added temporarily to allow a longer
    transition time for projects. These are still deprecated as
    SQLAlchemy-Migrate is not compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.x. They will
    be removed again in a future release.
