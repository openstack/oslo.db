upgrade:
  - |
    The ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.enginefacade.LegacyEngineFacade`` class and related
    helpers, namely ``_TransactionFactory.get_legacy_facade``,
    ``_TransactionContextManager.get_legacy_facade`` and ``get_legacy_facade``
    from the same module, have all been removed. The ``LegacyEngineFacade``
    class has been deprecated since 1.12.0 in favour of using the
    ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.enginefacade`` module directly.
