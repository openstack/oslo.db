    Added new option mysql_wsrep_sync_wait which sets the Galera
    "wsrep_sync_wait" variable on server login. This session-level variable
    allows Galera to ensure that writesets are fully up to date before running
    new queries, and may be used to tune application behavior when multiple
    Galera masters are targeted for SQL operations simultaneously.
