    The newly added mysql_wsrep_sync_wait parameter now defaults to non-present
    in the enginefacade's default configuration options, so that it is not
    configured in a MySQL / MariaDB database by default, unless passed in the
    options explicitly. Previously, the default value was "0", meaning the
    wsrep_sync_wait parameter would be set unconditionally on new connections,
    which would fail for MySQL backends that don't provide for this setting.
