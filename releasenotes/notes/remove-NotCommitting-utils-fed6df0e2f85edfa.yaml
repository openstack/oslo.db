upgrade:
  - |
    The following helpers have been removed from the
    ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.utils`` module:

    - ``NonCommittingConnectable``
    - ``NonCommittingEngine``
    - ``NonCommittingConnection``
    - ``NonCommittingTransaction``

    These were unused outside of oslo.db and were not compatible with
    SQLAlchemy 2.0. In addition, the ``RollsBackTransaction`` fixture has
    been removed from ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.test_fixtures``. This was
    similarly unused and presented similar compatibility issues.
