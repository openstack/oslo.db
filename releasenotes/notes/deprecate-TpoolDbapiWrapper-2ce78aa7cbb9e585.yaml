deprecations:
  - |
    The ``oslo_db.concurrency.TpoolDbapiWrapper`` class and supporting
    ``[database] use_tpool`` config option are now deprecated.
    This feature never graduated from experimental status and is slated for
    removal due to lack of maintenance and test coverage. Users should switch
    to ``oslo_db.api.DBAPI.from_config`` and remove references to the
    deprecated config option from their documentation.
